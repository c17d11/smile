Youko Hatta (born Youko Sugiyama), who had previously studied under Osamu Tezuka as an artist at Mushi Production, founded the company with her husband, Hideaki Hatta, in 1981. Kyoto Animation spent its early years doing finishing work for other companies' productions, but opened its own drawing department in 1986, the year following its establishment as a limited company. \n\nBy the mid-90s, the company had developed a strong reputation in the industry, as well as ties to studios such as Gonzo, Shin-Ei Animation, and Sunrise. Kyoto Animation released its first full in-house production—the first Munto OVA—in March 2003, and its first television anime, Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, in the summer of the same year. \n\nThe company gained worldwide attention on July 18, 2019 when an arson attack destroyed its original studio (known as Studio 1) in Fushimi, claiming the lives of 36 people.",

Ex-Mushi Production animators—including Masao Maruyama, Osamu Dezaki, Rintarou, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri—are often credited with founding the company in 1972, though Rintarou would not join the studio until 1982. Madhouse primarily did contract work for other studios until the 1990s, when it achieved success independently. Television adaptations of Trigun and Clamp's Cardcaptor Sakura in 1998 were hits domestically and later aired overseas, and the same year director Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue was released as his first of four critically-acclaimed films with the company. \n\nMadhouse remained successful throughout the 2000s and 2010s, adding director Mamoru Hosoda to its roster and releasing numerous popular television anime, including adaptations of Hajime no Ippo, Death Note, and One Punch Man. Maruyama stepped down from his role as president and left the company in June 2011 to start studio MAPPA.",
